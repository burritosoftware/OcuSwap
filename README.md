# OcuSwap - Oculus Home UI configuration utility

OcuSwap is a small standalone program that you can use to change the light void in Oculus Home to dark and adjust the intensity of the void's horizon! Simple console app to prevent having to do this manually.

## Note

This is my first C# program, and I'm learning a new language and new concepts by making useful utilities I would use. Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated!
