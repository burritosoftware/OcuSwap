# OcuSwap - Oculus Home UI configuration utility

OcuSwap is a small standalone program that you can use to change the light void in Oculus Home to dark, adjust the intensity of the void's horizon, or maybe even change the Air Link image to show a Quest 1 for all the Q1 owners out there.

## Note

This is my first C# program, and I'm learning a new language and new concepts by making useful utilities I would use. Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated!
